# Last Digit of Nth Fibonacci Number

The question: "The 7th Fibonacci number is 13, and its last digit is 3. What is the last digit of the 7777th Fibonacci number?"

## ‚¨Ü Going above and beyond ‚è≥

Solving this for N=7777 isn't that hard at all. But what if we wanted to solve this for arbitrarily large N? Can we develop a solution that computes the result in O(1) time and space? Naturally, this got me curious and I decided to break out a Jupyter notebook and start exploring this problem while providing commentary.
